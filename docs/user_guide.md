## Ratings and Reviews

To maintain a trustworthy and fair platform for everyone, UB Karaoke uses specific guidelines for reviews and ratings.

### Who Can Leave a Review?
- **Verified Bookings Only**: To leave a review, you must have successfully completed a booking at the venue. This ensures all feedback comes from actual customers.
- **Completed Status**: Your booking must have a status of `COMPLETED`. Cancelled, pending, or no-show bookings do not grant the ability to leave a review.

### How is the Overall Venue Rating Calculated?
We use a **Bayesian Average** rather than a simple mathematical average.
- **Why?** A simple average can be misleading. For instance, a venue with a single 5-star review would have a perfect 5.0 rating, outranking a highly reputable venue with one hundred 4.9-star reviews.
- **How it works**: The Bayesian method adds a baseline "confidence weight" to the calculation, pulling the score slightly toward the platform's average rating until the venue has accumulated enough reviews to stand on its own data (e.g., at least 5 reviews). This ensures that highly-rated venues have legitimately earned their score through consistent positive feedback.
